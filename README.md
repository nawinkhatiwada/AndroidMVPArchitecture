# Android MVP Architecture
Before starting, I assume
1. you know basics of **android** application development
2. Heard about **Android MVP Architecture.**
3. And are eager to learn **Android MVP Architecture** with different types of implementation. 

**AndroidMVPArchitecure Includes:**
1. Four branches viz  **master**, **mvp_with_rx_and_dagger**, **mvp_with_rx_and_kotlin** and **new_dagger_impl**
2. **master** -> Implementation of MVP Architecture without using Dagger, RxJava, RxAndroid
3. **mvp_with_rx_and_dagger** -> Implementation with Dagger2, RxJava, RxAndroid
4. **mvp_with_rx_and_kotlin** ->  Implementation with Dagger2, RxJava, RxAndroid, Kotlin
5. **new_dagger_impl** -> New Android Injector with Dagger 2, Java, RxJava, RxAndroid
6. **Unit testing with Mockito**

 # What is MVP?
 
![MVP Pattern](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/rajeshpillai/figure_1.jpg)

MVP is a user interface architectural pattern engineered to facilitate automated unit testing and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic:

The model is an interface defining the data to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the user interface.
The view is a passive interface that displays data (the model) and routes user commands (events) to the presenter to act upon that data.
The presenter acts upon the model and the view. It retrieves data from repositories (the model), and formats it for display in the view.
